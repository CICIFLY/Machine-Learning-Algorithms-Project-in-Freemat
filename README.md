# Description 
This folder contains projects that I have done at Machine Learning Algorithms class. 

# Algorithms Covered
* Regression (linear , non-linear , Logistic)
* Clustering (K-means)

# Data Sets:
pima_diabete data, Iris data and some specific-purpose data generated by software

# For Regression, there are three types:
* linear regression(less than 3 variables: x1,x2) , 
* plane linear regression(3 variables: x1, x2,x3) ,
* non-linear regression(sin-cos, paralo,paraloid,wave and iris) ( the variable someting like this: x^2 or cos(x), sin(x) ) . 

# Software:
Matlab
